# Falling In Love with Git in Six Acts 
**(inspired by [Nike's 1993 Vanity Fair Ad](http://www.rogerhorberry.com/falling-in-love-in-six-acts-courtesy-of-nike/))**

##1. LUST :heart_eyes:
Here it is, the big “Wow!” the big “Gee!” the big “YesYesYes!” you’ve been waiting for...**YOU HAVE A NEW PROJECT ASSIGNMENT**. This is where you decide to build something better, greater, cuter, wiser, more wonderful than anything anyone has ever known. Lust isn’t a sin, it’s a necessity, for with lust as our guide we think: I have no need of food, I have no need of sleep, I have no needs other than occasionally chewing a breath mint. I am going to code my face off. And so it begins...

*There are two paths to the start of this journey. Be sure to try them both on for size*

### Path-A) I create my project on the big Github :octocat: in the sky first:

- I visit my profile on GH and I create a new repo, following these [steps](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/)
- I name my repository EXACTLY as I plan to name the project on my computer, when I am ready to do a ```mkdir``
- On the GH, it will look something like this: my-awesome-project-name (because GH will substitute hyphens for spaces)

### Path-B) I create my project locally first:
```
mkdir <my_awesome_project_name>
cd <my_awesome_project_name>
git init
```
Boom. :boom: ```#Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/my_awesome_project_name/.git```

I want to share the love with everyone!!! How do I do this? OH RIGHT! I push my project up :arrow_up: to the big Github :octocat: in the sky. I will go there now and follow these [steps](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/). I will make sure that my GH repository name EXACTLY matches the name of my ```mkdir```, which is ```<my_awesome_project_name>```.
