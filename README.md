# Falling In Love with Git in Six Acts 
**(inspired by [Nike's 1993 Vanity Fair Ad](http://www.rogerhorberry.com/falling-in-love-in-six-acts-courtesy-of-nike/))**

##1. LUST :heart_eyes:
Here it is, the big “Wow!” the big “Gee!” the big “YesYesYes!” you’ve been waiting for...**YOU HAVE A NEW PROJECT ASSIGNMENT**. This is where you decide to build something better, greater, cuter, wiser, more wonderful than anything anyone has ever known. Lust isn’t a sin, it’s a necessity, for with lust as our guide we think: I have no need of food, I have no need of sleep, I have no needs other than occasionally chewing a breath mint. I am going to code my face off. And so it begins...
```
mkdir <my_awesome_project_name>
cd <my_awesome_project_name>
git init
```

##2. EUPHORIA :heart_eyes:
